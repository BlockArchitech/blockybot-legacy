<h1>BlockyBot - Rewritten in Python</h1>

I've decided to rewrite my discord bot, blockybot in python because:

The hosting provider i was using allowed me to create custom commands, embeds, etc, but the uptime was terrible, and i couldn't stand it.
I had to watch an AD every 30 miniutes to keep in online (like, come on)
Literally 0 support, like if it broke, they couldn't care less if they tried.

So im rewriting in in python. Anyone can use this as a template to make their own discord bot, if they would like, but you will need to add your OWN discord bot token in the .env file.
