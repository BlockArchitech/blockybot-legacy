# discord-bot
Rewrite of my discord bot.

<h1>Farewell.</h1>

All of my discord bots from this point and others have been programmed using th api wrapper discord.py.

discord.py is no longer maintained, and will be unsupported, as all discord bots are expected to use slash commands by april 2022, which discord.py does not support.

I've also looked into the possibility of adding slash commands to my bots, but it would take more time to do so than it would to just make a new bot in a new API wrapper.

<h2>What's this mean for blockybot?</h2>

BlockyBot, aswell as every single on of my other bots, will be taken offline. At this point in time, i'm not sure if i'll continue the blockybot project in another language, or just not revive blockybot.

All my bots repositories will be archived, and set into read only mode.

**Conclusion**

BlockyBot is going offline 9:00pm 12/8/2021 EST. I currently see no other option but to shutdown BlockyBot as discord will do it for me here in a few weeks, as I am using a legacy API wrapper. Consider this a Farewell, until BlockyBot returns.

<h1>About</h1>

I decided to re-write my discord bot in python because the service im currently using is pretty bad at their job.
This repo is just to track my progress, and if others find an issue with my code, then they can submit an issue.
That's purley what this is for. Just to track my progress and so you can follow along. If you feel like it,
you can also push a commit to improve my code, or add-on what you think is necesarry.

<h1>Required Packages</h1>

These are the **required** packages to run this bot.
