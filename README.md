# discord-bot
Rewrite of my discord bot.


<h1>About</h1>

I decided to re-write my discord bot in python because the service im currently using is pretty bad at their job.
This repo is just to track my progress, and if others find an issue with my code, then they can submit an issue.
That's purley what this is for. Just to track my progress and so you can follow along. If you feel like it,
you can also push a commit to improve my code, or add-on what you think is necesarry.
